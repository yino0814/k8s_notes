* **Components**

  * **API server**: the front-end for kubernetes. The users, management devices, Command line interfaces all talk to the API server to interact with the kubernetes cluster. In **Master**

  * **ETCD**: key-value store

  * **scheduler**: distributing work or containers across multiple nodes. looks for newly created containers and assigns them to Nodes

  * **controllers**: the brain. Noticing and responding when nodes, containers or endpoints goes down. Bring up new containers when down.

  * **container runtime**: underlying software that is used to run containers

  * kubelet: runs on each **node** in the cluster. Agent is responsible for making sure that the containers are running on the nodes as expected.

* List vs Dictionary cs List of Dictionaries

  * ![1-1](image/1-1.PNG)

  * ![1-2](image/1-2.PNG)

  * **List**: ordered **Dictionary**: unordered

* YAML in K8s

  * ![1-3](image/1-3.PNG))

  * **metadata**: a dictionary with **name** and **labels(another dictionary)**

  * **Spec**: containers: a list/array because can have multiple containers in a pod

  * `kubectl create -f pod-def.yml` to create the pod

  * `kubectl describe pod pod_name` for details of the pod

* Replication controller, replica set : main difference: selector

  * Replication controller:

    * helps us run multiple instances of a single POD in the kubernetes cluster thus providing High Availability.

    * to create multiple PODs to share the load across them, balance the load between multiple pods. e.g. when adding additional pods across other nodes in the cluster.

    * ![1-4](image/1-4.PNG)

    * `kubectl create -f rc-def.yml` to create the replication controller

    * `kubectl get replicationcontroller` to view

  * Replica set:

    * `apiVersion: app/v1`

    * `kind: ReplicaSet`

    * in `spes`: need a `selector` section, because replica set can also manage pods that were not created as part of the ReplicaSet creation. e.g. the replica set can also take pods created before the creation of the ReplicaSet when creating replicas.

    * ![1-5](image/1-5.PNG)

  * Scale the replicaset

    * change the `replicas` number and run `kubectl replace -f rc-def.yaml`

    * or **edit** with `kubectl edit replicaset myapp-replicaset`

    * or **scale** run `kubectl scale —-replicas=6 -f rc-def.yaml`

    * or run `kubectl scale —replicas=6 replicaset(type) myapp-replicaset(actual name)` but the replicas in the default file will not change with this method.

  * wrapup

    `> kubectl create -f replicaset-definition.yml `

    `> kubectl get replicaset`

    `> kubectl delete replicaset myapp-replicaset # also delete the pods`

    `> kubectl replace replicaset-definition.yml `

    `> kubectl scale -replicas=6 replicaset-definition.yml`

    `> kubectl explain replicaset`  # to find details of a kind

* **Deployment**

  * **1.** many **running instances**; **2.** upgrade **docker** instances seamlessly, but not upgrade everything the same time - r**olling update**; **3. Rollback**; **4.** not applied immediately after the command - a pause to your environment, make changes, and resume all the changes rolled out together

  * Deployment:

    * kind: Deployment  (other same as replicaset)

    * `kubectl get all`

    * `kubectl create deployment name-of-deployment —image=nginx —replicas=3`

    * ![1-6](image/1-6.PNG)

* Update and rollback

  * update: 

    * `kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment `(will show 1/n replicas  ready)

    * `kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp-deployment`

    * ![1-7](image/1-7.PNG)

    * Change-cause is none because it is not recording anything, can add `—record` to the `kubectl create -f deployment.yaml` command

    * deployment strategy:

      * recreate: kill all containers and rollout new versions (will have the down time so X used)

      * rolling update: default strategy

    * `kubectl apply -f deployment-definition.yaml`

      or `kubectl set image deployment/myapp-deployment nginx=nginx:1.7.1`

    * ![1-8](image/1-8.PNG)

  * rollout:

    * `kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-deployment`

  * ![1-9](image/1-9.PNG)

  * If do kubectl edit deployment myapp-deployment, and edit the image with wrong details, k8s will only kill one pod and try to create with new images, just stuck. So the users can still access the pods.
